    attributes:
      - id: priority
        type: int
        brief: Enables prioritizing and de-prioritizing collection of telemetry.
        note: >
          This attribute is useful to express a user's desire to
          collect an item of telemetry, in spite of the default
          sampling mechanism.  Samplers SHOULD export items with a
          non-zero value, independent of probability sampling.
          Samplers SHOULD NOT export items with this attribute set to
          zero.
        examples: [1, 0]

      - id: randomness
        type: string
        brief: The source of randomness for making probability sampling decisions, when it is not otherwise recorded.
        note: >
          This attribute is an optional way to express trace
          randomness, especially for cases where the TraceID is
          missing or known to be not random.  This value is a
          hex-coded string containing 14 hex digits (56 bits) of
          randomness.  Setting this attribute indicates the source of
          randomness that was used (and may be used again) for
          probability sampling.  This field is taken to have the same
          meaning as the OpenTelemetry tracestate "R-value" for
          probability sampling, which is an alternative to deriving
          trace randomness from the TraceID specified in OTEP 235.

      - id: threshold
        type: string
        brief: Sampling probability as specified by OpenTelemetry.
        note: >
          This attribute is set to convey sampling probability from
          samplers to consumers of spans and log records, taken to
          have the same meaning as the OpenTelemetry tracestate
          "T-value" for probability sampling.  This attribute contains
          a hexadecimal-coded value containing 1 to 14 hex digits of
          precision, defining the threshold used to reject, depending
          on the random variable.  This value can be converted into
          sampling probability as specified in OTEP 235.
        examples: ["c", "ff8"]
