        type: string
        brief: The source of randomness for making probability sampling decisions, when it is not otherwise recorded.
        note: >
          This attribute is an optional way to express trace
          randomness, especially for cases where the TraceID is
          missing or known to be not random.  Sampler components set
          and consume this value.  The value is a hex-coded string
          containing 14 hex digits (56 bits) of randomness.  Setting
          this attribute indicates the source of randomness that was
          used (and may be used again) for probability sampling.  This
          field is taken to have the same meaning as the OpenTelemetry
          tracestate "R-value" for probability sampling, which is an
          alternative to deriving trace randomness from the TraceID.
          For details, see OTEP 235.

      - id: threshold
        type: string
        brief: Sampling probability as specified by OpenTelemetry.
        note: >
          This attribute is set to convey sampling probability.
          Sampler components set and consume this value, which is
          taken to have the same meaning as the OpenTelemetry
          tracestate "T-value" for probability sampling.  This
          attribute contains a hexadecimal-coded value containing 1 to
          14 hex digits of precision, defining the threshold used to
          reject, depending on the random variable.  This value can be
          converted into sampling probability.  For details, see OTEP
          235.
